# This is my first attempt at building a digital assistant with Python

This lovely assistant is named Alexa. It is built with Python as an exercice to familiarize myself with this language.

To run it, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I'm using version 3.6.8), [Speech Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/), [Python Text to Speech](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/), and [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/#files).

To run it : clone the project and type "python main.py" in a terminal and speak ! Make sure your microphone is on !
